`python-template-jupyter` is written in Python and JavaScript. While prebuilt wheels are provided for end users, it is also straightforward to build `python-template-jupyter` from either the Python [source distribution](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/source-distribution-format/) or the GitHub repository.

## Make commands

As a convenience, `python-template-jupyter` uses a `Makefile` for commonly used commands. You can print the main available commands by running `make` with no arguments

```bash
> make

build                          build the library
clean                          clean the repository
fix                            run autofixers
install                        install library
lint                           run lints
test                           run the tests
```

## Prerequisites

`python-template-jupyter` has a few system-level dependencies which you can install from your machine package manager. Other package managers like `conda`, `nix`, etc, should also work fine.

## Clone

Clone the repo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/python-project-templates/python-template-jupyter.git
cd python-template-jupyter
```

## Install NodeJS

Follow the instructions for [installing NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all) for your system. Once installed, you can [install `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) with:

```bash
npm install --global pnpm
```

## Install Python dependencies

Python build and develop dependencies are specified in the `pyproject.toml`, but you can manually install them:

```bash
make requirements
```

Note that these dependencies would otherwise be installed normally as part of [PEP517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) / [PEP518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/).

## Build

Build the python project in the usual manner:

```bash
make build
```

## Lint and Autoformat

`python-template-jupyter` has linting and auto formatting.
